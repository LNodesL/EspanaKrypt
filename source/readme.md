# EspanaKrypt Source
Included is the EspanaKrypt.cpp (crypter), Armada.cpp (original stub), Galleon.h (the bytes array header include of compiled Armada.exe).

## EspanaKrypt.cpp
This is the main crypter file that includes the Galleon.h file include and all needed logic to replace a resource for future crypts to replace the program that is executed in runtime.

## Galleon.h
Generated by utils/BTCH as a header file include containing the bytes data for tmp/Armada.exe 

## Armada.cpp
The original stub file that has all logic for executing a binary in runtime. Is used to compile the tmp/Armada.exe for the build process.

## helloworld.cpp
Simple test file to compile into a PE to test the crypter (EspanaKrypt.exe) by dragging & dropping helloworld onto the crypter, or by CLI.

## Forked / Origin Story
EspanaKrypt is a fork of Ricky5panish's PE Runtime Crypter. 

Changes made:

- an easier method to convert the original PE to bytes for inclusion in the crypter (BTCH)
- documentation for normal usage & devs
